  :content: |-
    Some computers are "corporate systems" and they have
    networking settings that may prevent the system from working with Amahi's handy short URLs.
    If <code> http://hda </code> does not work, use <code> <b> http://hda.home.com </b> </code>
    (with your own internal domain instead of home.com).

- :header: Automatic Amahi Updates
  :content: |-
    Amahi updates are automatic. Amahi updates and
    critical updates in the distribution are automatic.
    The rest of the updates are left to your choice. Some people
    prefer to not update if the system is stable, while others like
    to have the latest updates. We recommend you only perform security updates.
- :header: "Install Tip: Warnings During Install"
  :content: |-
    You may see some security updates during install. This is normal. It's best if you do NOT
    perform updates while the installer is going on. Wait until
    your system has rebooted and is fully functional. Later, we recommend
    you only perform security updates.
